# 🌌 Explore Exoplanets

Explore Exoplanets is an interactive web interface that allows users to explore exoplanets using visual and animated data from NASA.  
The project also includes an integrated AI model capable of predicting the habitability and classification of exoplanets based on scientific datasets.  
The model is designed to continuously improve through self-learning as new astronomical data becomes available.

## 🧠 AI Model

The AI model, developed and trained in Google Colab, analyzes scientific datasets containing planetary parameters such as radius, stellar distance, and orbital characteristics.  
It was trained on labeled exoplanet data and achieved a 77% accuracy on testing data.  

The model predicts, in percentage, the likelihood that a given celestial object is an exoplanet.  
Built with Python and machine learning techniques, it uses data preprocessing and classification algorithms to enhance discovery efficiency.
